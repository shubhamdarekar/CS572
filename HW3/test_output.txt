odie is

who likes

mongolia where

for his

s pretty
much the
movie which
switches between
snippets of
pena encountering
tuvan musicians
and singing
before appreciative
audiences they
also in
their enthusiastic
bravado accidentally
blow up
wonders of
the ancient

the sometimes
intentionally flawed

is well
almost flawless

you love
history the
civil war
in particular
you ll
want to
see gods
and generals
but if
you re
more curious
than committed
know that
this ted
turner production
can feel
every bit
of its
three hours
and minutes
not counting
intermission based
on jeffrey
m shaara
s novel
of the
same name
gods and
generals is
a prequel
to turner
s ample
gettysburg based
on the
killer angels
written by
shaara s
deceased father
michael the
new film
takes place
during the
early years
of the
war roughly
when the
nation was
just beginning
to eviscerate
itself covering
such major
battles as
bull run
fredericksburg and
chancellorsville the
movie is
told more
from a
southern perspective
as opposed
to its
predecessor which
tended to
have a
more northern
point of
view the
movie also
emphasizes the
human scale
of this
massive national
self massacre
given the
enormous volume
and the
ephemerality of
information available
today keyword
searches are
the appropriate
future for
information retrieval
the key
to using
search engines
effectively she
argues is
to understand
the business
of information
the movie
is so
laid back
that it
s hard
not to
get excited
when the
musician starts
to freak
out because
he s
almost out
of medicine
and a
member of
the u
s entourage
has a
heart attack
not to
worry these
doses of
trouble are
soon resolved
the drum
dwelling evil
spirit believed
to be
responsible for
the mishaps
is taken
care of
by a
shaman then
the film
continues to
meander along
in its
carefree fashion
gerry is
apparently what
you get
when you
send director
gus van
sant drugstore
cowboy good
will hunting
and actors
casey affleck
brother of
ben and
matt damon
friend of
ben into
the desert
with a
camera they
should ve
brought along
the late

least a
couple of
his plays

as a
dual hat
assignment with

expert consulting

the movie
might ve
been funny
or meant
something gerry
is the
name of
both protagonists
who are
introduced riding
in a
dusty car
through death
valley van
sant shows
them in
long shot
mid shot
and finally
close up
holding each
shot interminably
it s
a portent
of longer
shots to
come the
gerrys decide
to park
the car
and walk
the wilderness
trail but
early on
they head
off the
marked trail
to find
the thing
that s
when you
realize this
isn t
just a
movie about
a hike
gone wrong
it s
a metaphysical
journey yea
though we
walk through
death valley
they kid
around they
get lost
they climb
mountains to
see where
they are
they stage
a mildly
funny clown
show when
affleck gets
stuck on
top of
a rock
they get
more lost
as time
passes and
hunger and
thirst set
in they
realize this
could be
serious to
his credit
van sant
is trying
something more
experimental than
his recent
warm n
cozy movies
like finding
forrester as
he circles
his actors
in loooong
slow loops
or fixes
on them
in loooooonger
profile close
up they
improvise dialogue
that s
bargain basement
beckett at
best almost
inevitably your
mind drifts
you find
yourself putting
together a
grocery list
wondering if
you ll
get home
before the
dog stains
the carpet
trying to
decide why
casey is
better looking
than his
more famous
brother yet
the film
has a
weird on
and off
appeal you
get hooked
on its
sheer contrariness
a hard
headed attempt
to balance
its inherent
pretentiousness with
its marked
prettiness the
landscapes are
gorgeous the
film is
inherently silly
yet egregiously
sure of
itself so
you drift
back in
then out
then in
then if
nothing else
gerry is
restful though
i m
not sure
that counts
as a
recommendation description
when berke

dumped by
the school

he even

cent what
we re
left with
is a
movie that
at times
barely seems
to move
it feels
like it
lasts three
hours and
a lead
actor who
doesn t
just look
bored but
delivers so
many of
his lines
like he
d rather
be anywhere
else review
ancient japan

pretty strange
place says
dead eyed
vamp louise
tricia vessey
in director
jim jarmusch
s ghost

way of
the samurai
the same
goes for
the film
s version
of modern
new york
after all
the emotionless
louise has
just watched
her lover
get shot
to death
and she
s addressing
her comment
to his
contract killer
she even
lends him
her copy
of the

who saved
him as
a teenager
from thugs
louie john
tormey a
tubby graying
soldier working
for gang
boss vargo
henry silva
louise is
vargo s
daughter so
you could
say the
contract whack
of her
boyfriend is
an ultimate
expression of
parental disapproval
the problem
is louise
wasn t
supposed to
be at
the crime
scene when
the hit
occurred so
vargo demands
that ghost
dog pay
for his
mistake by
being erased
from the
planet what
follows is
a series
of moves
and countermoves
as ghost
dog tries
to stay
loyal to
louie even
as louie
s cronies
try to
track and
kill him
it s
a fairly
equal match
ghost dog
points out
we re
from different
ancient tribes
and now
we re
both almost
extinct with
one droopy
lidded eye
and the
other sharp
and clear
whitaker makes
a fascinating
lone wolf
radiating both
outward alertness
and inward
zen jarmusch
places him
in a
pungently off
key world
thugs stare

sense of
culture clash
giving ghost

from french
guiana the
lively isaach
de bankole
it hardly
matters that
neither of
them understands
the other
s language
as a
tired louie
exclaims nothing
makes any
sense anymore
as in
his moody
kind of
western dead
man jarmusch
takes a
film genre
and puts
his own
spin on
it his
trademark restraint
and deadpan
minimalism are
at work
but they
re used
to re
imagine this
world of
blood and
vendettas in
a fresh
way in
this sopranos
mad year
it s
to his
credit that
he takes
the overused
gangster genre
and makes
it compellingly
unfamiliar ghost
ship sails
into theaters
just in
time for
halloween but
audiences will
feel more
tricked than
treated after
sitting through
this silly
gorefest that
wastes the
talents of
several good
actors though
ghost ship
does offer
a few
and we
stress few
gotcha jolts
director steven
beck thirteen
ghosts is
more interested
in staging
friday the
th like
bloody deaths
than true
suspense needless
to say
with such
gruesome images
as passengers

impaled ghost
ship isn

film for
the faint
of heart
karl urban

the remains
of the
fabled antonia
graza thought
lost at
sea for
more than
years the
ship however
holds a
murderous secret
along with
a fortune
in unmarked
gold bullion
before you
can say
shiver me
timbers the
salvage crew
becomes victims
of unfortunate
accidents you
can pretty
much predict
the order
of their
deaths by
where the
actors are
billed in
the opening
credits although
margulies is
stuck in
a dead
end film
her magnetic
intensity makes
her the
only character
worth watching
washington is
mildly amusing
as a

be married
crew member
who thinks
it s
not really
cheating if
he does
the nasty
with a
shapely ghost

he won
oscars for
titanic but
director james
cameron s
obsession with
the doomed
ship has
continued steaming
ahead that
s good
news if
you want
to experience
the next
best thing
to riding
a sub
to the
bottom of
the north
atlantic and
prowling around
the sunken
ocean liner
in the
spectacular d
imax documentary
ghosts of
the abyss
cameron travels
with a
handpicked crew
of scientists
and his
old acting
buddy bill
paxton to
take another
look at
history s
most famous
shipwreck it
s the
first film
made with
the reality
camera system
co invented
by cameron
it generates
d imagery
so convincing
you may
want to
take a
plastic bag
for seasickness
paxton serves
as our
everyman guide
while he
s played
men stuck
in tight
cockpits before
in both
titanic and
apollo this
time it
s for
real and
his very
real anxiety
pops when
he gets
sealed up
with two
crewmates inside
a tiny
mir sub
and admits
it s
maybe a
little more
adventure than
i wanted
more than
two miles
below the
waves fear
changes to
wonder there
lies the
rusting behemoth
once considered
for five
short days
in april
to be
the man
made glory
of the
ocean before
an iceberg
sent it
and some
passengers to
a cold
black grave
we ve
seen much
of the
ship before
a lot
of it
in cameron
s epic
which interlaced
its fictional
love story
with real
wreckage footage
but ghosts
trumps those
images with
the depth
and clarity
of the
d process
and the
probing work
of a
couple called
jake and
elwood the
bots penetrate
the ship
s fragile
husk to
show us
things we
ve never
seen before
the dining
room s
intricate leaded
windows still
intact a
locked gate
used to
contain panicked
steerage passengers
elaborately carved
columns and
mantelpieces filigreed
elevator doors
even molly
brown s
brass bed
this would
all be
eye popping
enough but
cameron deepens
the impact
by superimposing
photos of
the ship
s original
interiors helping
orient us
on the
journey he
also overlays
scenes of
actors playing
passengers re
creating key
moments from
the ship
s last
night the
technique reminds
us of
the human
cost involved
climaxing in
a re
creation of
the ship
s final
plunge as
titanic goes
down the
screen fills
with photos
of its
victims hurtling
through the
dark night
sky like
shooting stars
the film
is such
a visual
triumph it
hardly matters
that parts
of it
are arranged
a little
awkwardly scenes
of the
expedition s
crew playing
volleyball or
eating borscht
bump up
against the
eerie underwater
images in
ways that
don t
always gel
but when
cameron returns
to the
surface after
one dive
the date
is sept
news of
the terrorist
attacks in
the united
states brings
an extra
dose of
sadness to
this history
of titanic
for the
record it
wasn t
the worst
maritime disaster
torpedoed by
a soviet
sub in
the german
ship the
wilhelm gustloff
took nearly
passengers with
it many
of them
refugees including
wounded soldiers
women and
children but
with its
luxe trappings
and purported
unsinkability the
titanic has
monopolized popular
imagination with
the power
of a
classical tragedy
ghosts of
the abyss
gives that
tragedy its
due terry
zwigoff s
funny sad
and peculiar
ghost world
one of
the most
engaging films
of the
year zwigoff
who made
that anatomy
of eccentricity
crumb co
wrote the
movie with
daniel clowes
upon whose
graphic novel
ghost world
is based
because despite
their studied
disaffection they
are not
numb indeed
they may
feel too
much at
the sight
of a
kindred outcast
spirit the
school fat
guy or
a rule
breaking hick
enid s
face softens
in a
flush of
empathy she
reserves her
enthusiasm for
those who
walk outside
the lines
swinging a
bat ghost
world has
a static
energy that
can be
as listless
as enid
s will
as though
the air
has been
sucked out
of it
zwigoff uses
simple compositions
that echo
clowes washed
out one
dimensional comic
panels the
film is
more visually
clever than
it looks
it s
around the
end that
ghost world
falters unlike
rebecca enid
doesn t
learn how
to reconcile
her temperament
with society
s she
alienates the
world and
cries about
it but
this isn
t so
different from
what most
teen agers
do her
despair is
too callow
to be
tragic and
if she
makes no
effort to
change how
can she
be a
failure epperson
s whodunit
is pretty
obvious however
what works
best here
isn t
the red
herring strewn
plot but
its shrewd
details raimi
creates some
ominously chilling
visions for
annie and
the ensemble
cast does
well with
the broadly
drawn characters
holmes nails
the flirty
country club
vixen while
reeves is
properly doltish
as the
brutish husband
and ribisi
conveys his
character s
instability beautifully
before it
opened it
was infamous
for being
the movie
that spawned
l affaire
jennifer lopez
ben affleck
now that
it s
arrived at
the multiplex
it can
be judged
for what
it is
a disaster
of spectacular
proportions larry
gigli affleck
is a
lunkheaded mob
enforcer with
an unpronounceable
name it
rhymes with
really he
keeps saying
his new
assignment is
to kidnap
the younger
brother of
a federal
judge who
has the
power to
put some
crooked new
york based
mob boss
away for
life next
thing you
know we
re in
a bargain
basement version
of rain
man the
brother brian
justin bartha
is a
brain damaged
kid irritating
but a
sweetheart and
as obsessed
with baywatch
as dustin
hoffman was
with bluelight
specials as
far back
as aristophanes
romantic comedies
have needed
obstacles to
work it
used to
be traditional
notions of
women s
sexuality no
sex before
marriage etc
were obstacle
enough but
in the
wake of
birth control
women in
the workplace
and a
shifting social
climate that
no longer
works thus
the obstacles
have become
increasingly far
fetched opposite
coasts in
sleepless in
seattle or
a wedding
planner falling
in love
with the
groom to
be in
lopez s
the wedding
planner the
roadblock in
gigli is
that ricki
is a
happy lesbian
and even
a sex
god like
um gigli
may not
be able
to sway
her the
movie is
airless and
inane you
feel suffocated
by scenes
that have
no weight
for instance
gigli and
ricki drop
by his
mother s
lainie kazan
for some
spurious non
reason the
real reason
of course
is so
director martin
brest can
have a
scene in
which mom
gives her
blessings to
lesbianism yet
encourages the
idea that
lesbians can
go both
ways when
the right
fella comes
along all
the while
kazan eyes
j lo
like a
whale courting
a piece
of plankton
and whatever
chemistry lopez
and affleck
have in
real life
curdles on
screen watching
him try
to distract
her sexually
while she
s reading
a book
is embarrassing
think winnie
the pooh
coming on
to catherine
zeta jones
lopez is
the only
one who
gets out
of this
alive and
even so
she s
pretty badly
maimed after
delivering a
sexual politics
monologue while
doing some
sort of
exercise meditation
that must
ve been
culled from
the kama
sutra the
script written
by brest
of scent
of a
woman infamy
gives her
zilch so
lopez falls
back on
her diva
power in
all its
tawny sexuality
and ferocious
me ness
she gives
you something
to watch
even if
it s
something you
d prefer
not to
see christopher
walken stumbles
through a
small scene
trying to
charge a
superfluous character
with some
kind of
oomph and
just when
you think
things can
t possibly
get any
worse al
pacino shows
up in
a performance
so ripely
hammy you
half expect
him to
turn into
a pork
rind review
when teenager
diana guzman
michelle rodriguez
stares out
her tenement
window at
a young
woman struggling
home with
an infant
and a
toddler you
know she
s afraid
she s
glimpsing her
own future
but in
girlfight writer
director karyn
kusama s
rousing debut
diana decides
to buck
the self
fulfilling prophecies
of urban
surrender only
one fistfight
away from
getting expelled
from school
the trigger
tempered girl
decides to
channel her
anger into
boxing lessons
at the
gym where
her kid
brother tiny
ray santiago
trains she
isn t
exactly welcomed
with open
arms why
not aerobics
one of
the old
regulars asks
her when
a bully
messing with
tiny winds
up at
the business
end of
diana fist
he sneers
i guess
you never
learned how
to be
a lady
no not
by his
terms but
she learns
how to
take care
of and
control herself
even though
she has
to learn
to punch
without her
father finding
out sundance
plus the
young cinema
award at
the cannes
film festival
is a
mix of
clean storytelling
tough edge
and gritty
urban texture
the movie
is produced
by maggie
renzi longtime
producer and
longtime companion
of independent
film director
john sayles
who makes
a cameo
here as
diana s
distracted math
teacher the
association is
appropriate in
her very
first feature
kusama delivers
a work
that shares
sayles attraction
to a
working class
settings girlfight
also has
some of
sayles clear
eyed but
tender understanding
of its
characters everyone
here has
more than
one side
and kusama
loves their
foibles as
much as
their strengths
she s
also not
immune to
a shameless
sort of
plot twist
that threatens
to pit
diana against
her own
newfound boxing
boyfriend adrian
santiago douglas
in the
ring the
growing relationship
between these
two is
as interesting
as the
fighting matches
which kusama
stages dynamically
we see
how both
adrian and
diana gather
self worth
first from
their wins
on the
mat then
through the
respect they
give each
other as
young as
they are
they re
both veterans
of the
rough life
maybe life
s just
war period
but girlfight
believably shows
them learning
how to
win or
at least
stay up
on their
feet it
s a
crowdpleaser that
never sacrifices
its brain
to the
sucker punch
tricks of
so many
hollywood films
jolie provides
the fireworks
but producer
star winona
ryder gives
the film
its steadying
heartfelt center
the actress
snapped up
the rights
to susanna
kaysen s
memoir of
her two
year stint
in an
upscale psychiatric
hospital in
the late
s but
it took
her almost
six years
to find
a suitable
director she
hit pay
dirt with
james mangold
heavy copland
who eschews
the genre
s potential
touchy feely
pitfalls and
opts for
a rip
roaring tone
more akin
to one
flew over
the cuckoo
s nest
girl interrupted
leans a
little too
heavily on
the s
dictum that
only the
crazy are
sane and
a last
act confrontation
is as
superfluous as
it is
over the
top but
overall the
movie is
a wonderful
surprise especially
for those
expecting a
kind of
women as
victims update
of the
snake pit
vanessa redgrave
once an
icon of
madness the
many loves
of isadora
as the
imposing yet
sympathetic head
therapist jeffrey
tambor as
a superficially
foolish yet
genuinely caring
doctor and
whoopi goldberg
who may
look like
a cross
between angela
davis and
buddha in
her s
afro and
serape but
who understands
susanna better
than anyone
else telling
her you
re a
lazy self
indulgent little
girl who
s driving
herself crazy
jolie s
role is
a built
in showcase
but to
her credit
she does
many daring
and unexpected
things with
it ryder
is in
charge of
her camera
ready fragility
and vulnerability
using it
in a
shrewdly nuanced
portrayal that
s the
best work
she s
ever done
it s
got too
much naked
skin and
too big
and fat
of an
r rating
to be
a bona
fide teen
movie but
set in
a high
school it
is with
an unfathomable
plot about
an officious
student council
president who
one day
discovers a
curvy porn
star has
moved in
next door
to boot
the curtains
on her
bedroom window
are wide
open of
course the
porn star
with a
heart of
gold and
a stuffed
teddy bear
falls for
our nerd
they date
they kiss
and before
long the
senior prom
looks like
it s
a backdrop
for a
new porn
venture but
much of
the film
s lascivious
nature is
at its
very soul
a tease
did we
forget to
say this
was a
feel good
hollywood studio
movie a
clear eyed
cousin of
sorts to
cruise s
top box
office film
then it
was prostitution
now its
hard core
porn girl
next door
has sexual
chemistry to
burn it
doesn t
even attempt
to create
a fresh
screen milieu
when cuthbert
first strips
in slo
mo of
course the
film s
soundtrack pulsates
with the
same kind
of entrancing
tonal reverberations
that audiences
heard when
cruise and
demornay immortalized
their film
with a
steamy scene
inside a
chicago subway
car timothy
olyphant scream
and hbo
s deadwood
shows up
as a
porn director
looking like
he s
channeling the
moussed fashionata
of blade
villain stephen
dorff his
character is
normally a
paper thin
villain in
this kind
of film
but the
script gives
him extra
bite making
him honestly
friendly one
moment and
creepily edgy
the next
hirsch also
has two
geeky friends
who ll
make you
laugh and
a high
school full
of outrageous
cliques as
one of
the sports
jocks shouts

patrice leconte
has made
two of
my favorite
films monsieur
hire and
the hairdresser
s husband
so i
was hardly
surprised when
his new
picture girl
on the
bridge began
on such
an enticingly
dolorous and
intriguing note
a spectacularly
gorgeous gamin
vanessa paradis
we re
talking in
the same
league as
jean seberg
in breathless
is making
a confession
to an
off screen
presence a
therapist we
assume we
soon learn
she s
as stunningly
depressed as
she is
stunningly beautiful
barely in
her s
she already
sees her
life as
a waiting
room in
which all
sorts of
people rush
by with
places to
go people
to meet
they are
it turns
out a
match made
in movie
heaven she
s suicidal
he s
a professional
knife thrower
always in
search of
a new
target they
become a
team and
suddenly their
luck turns
everything that
happens is
good her
faith in
him restores
both his
skill and
his faith
in himself
his faith
in her
well let
s just
say that
soon she
s flashing
her smashing
smile and
back to
sleeping around
though not
with him
despite the
undeniable erotic
charge in
their relationship
filmed in
a luminous
black and
white girl
on the
bridge initially
creates an
aura of
romantic intensity
as well
as a
humorous look
at the
fringe life
of a
specialty act
knife throwers
we learn
never follow
silent acts
part of
the problem
is the
embarassing age
difference between
the two
leads which
of course
is a
pointless complaint
these days
more troubling
is the
way their
relationship never
grows at
first we
re engaged
by these
characters but
then we
want something
to grab
us emotionally
to make
us want
them to
stay together
at all
costs and
that simply
doesn t
happen the
movie wants
to say
things about
luck and
chance and
the freakish
fairy tale
aspect of
true love
but mostly
it just
says that
if you
ever feel
like jumping
off a
bridge you
re more
likely to
be stopped
if you
look like
paradis than
if you
look like
janet reno
like the
tracy chevalier
novel on
which it
s based
the movie
imagines a
back story
for the
famous girl
with a
pearl earring
painted by
dutch master
johannes vermeer
in th
century delft
griet scarlett
johansson is
a dutch
girl rented
out as
a servant
to the
vermeer household
after her
working class
father is
blinded in
an accident
but he
takes an
interest in
griet perhaps
it s
her inner
stillness in
the midst
of so
much mindless
commotion perhaps
it s
the way
she asks
whether she
should clean
the studio
windows as
ordered by
others noting
that in
doing so
she ll
change the
quality of
the light
or perhaps
it s
because of
her luminous
skin and
huge watchful
eyes because
she s
the only
one granted
access to
vermeer s
inner sanctum
his studio
griet is
viewed by
everyone else
with suspicion
and envy
for good
reason as
her relationship
with vermeer
subtly evolves
from a
servant with
potential to
a trusted
apprentice to
the model
for one
of the
most haunting
portraits ever
painted there
s a
hint of
bashful jane
eyre overpowering
mr rochester
in their
scenes together
which gives
them a
slight erotic
tingle but
webber wisely
keeps the
focus on
the work
and on
the world
that surrounds
it inside
vermeer s
cramped candlelit
studio griet
is introduced
to the
mysteries of
light texture
and shade
to the
beauty of
lapis lazul
to the
secrets of
the camera
obscura outside
she s
caught up
in the
tactile crowded
world of
delft a
bustling mercantile
city with
a teeming
street life
to rival
franco zeffirelli
s verona
in romeo
and juliet
firth brings
the requisite
semi banked
fire to
his role
as the
brooding artist
whose ardor
for his
work is
often heedless
of the
feelings of
those around
him as
always the
actor does
the dashing
thing flawlessly
unfortunately webber
lacks chaplin
s delicate
way with
a story
the transcendent
richness of
eduardo serra
s cinematography
and ben
van os
production design
only emphasizes
the weakness
of the
script which
manages to
be both
slight and
melodramatic we
re immersed
in vermeer
s exquisite
artistry but
we re
kept distanced
from the
characters at
the very
end we
re invited
to gaze
briefly at
vermeer s
masterwork and
in that
minute and
a half
we connect
more vitally
with what
s on
screen than
we have
with anything
in the
preceding and
a half
minutes and
perhaps that
s the
movie s
point everything
old is
gloriously new
again in
gladiator a
sweeping vibrant
eye popping
re invention
of the
old sword
and sandals
genre that
most of
us thought
was if
not gone
with the
wind at
least as
tattered as
kirk douglas
spartacus toga
but before
maximus can
make up
his mind
frankly he

but our
hero somehow
escapes ends
up a
slave is
bought by
proximo the
late oliver
reed and
trained as
a gladiator
the upside
is that
proximo knows
star power
when he
sees it
and as
maximus brings
his battle
honed skills
into the
arena his
boss smells
the big
time i
e rome
the timing
here is
doubly fortuitous
first commodus
has decided
to play
to the
mob by
feeding them
a steady
diet of
bread and
circuses in
which death
becomes spectacle
wrestlemania in
its purest
form second
maximus long
simmering hatred
for commodus
means one
thing that
he longs
to get
within a
sword s
length of
him and
that s
something that
superstardom in
the arena
can deliver
there s
a touch
of love
stuff in
the air
but only
a touch
commodus has
certain incestuous
yearnings for
his far
more talented
sister lucilla
connie nielsen
who shares
a sketched
in romantic
past with
maximus this
part is
frankly forced
more to
the point
she has
a young
son which
gives her
mad brother
control over
her lest
he harm
the boy
but essentially
what we
get is
pure crowe
and that
s something
to crow
about the
pageant of
death that
commodus stages
daily is
as violent
as it
is jaw
droppingly watchable
a measure
perhaps of
our new
millennium jadedness
yet standing
at its
center always
is crowe
hewing to
his slogan
strength and
honor crowe
gives the
picture its
well brave

unlike gibson

he fights

you love
history the
civil war
in particular
you ll
want to
see gods
and generals
but if
you re
more curious
than committed
know that
this ted
turner production
can feel
every bit
of its
three hours
and minutes
not counting
intermission based
on jeffrey
m shaara
s novel
of the
same name
gods and
generals is
a prequel
to turner
s ample
gettysburg based
on the
killer angels
written by
shaara s
deceased father
michael the
new film
takes place
during the
early years
of the
war roughly
when the
nation was
just beginning
to eviscerate
itself covering
such major
battles as
bull run
fredericksburg and
chancellorsville the
movie is
told more
from a
southern perspective
as opposed
to its
predecessor which
tended to
have a
more northern
point of
view the
movie also
emphasizes the
human scale
of this
massive national
self massacre
not just
in the
corpse strewn
battlefields and
quieter moments
with the
generals and
their men
but even
in the
opening credits
which appear
against a
dozen or
more billowing
flags there
are banners
from everywhere
the th
massachusetts the
rd arkansas
the th
new york
the th
georgia the
movie treats
the material
with respect
the people
who put
it together
have a
deep personal
attachment to
these events
they feel
honor bound
to get
every bridle
every epaulet
every battle
plan absolutely
right however
gods and
generals is
not as
good as
gettysburg for
one thing
it s
too diffuse
necessarily so
perhaps since
it covers
more ground
and even
buffs will
notice that
more could
have been
done to
flesh out
the characters
we get
their courage
their valor
and their
prayers hence
the title
gods and
generals lee
and jackson
were both
very religious
but there
s not
much emotional
involvement the
decision was
made perhaps
by some
market research
nitwit trying
to attract
more women
that there
should be
scenes with
the soldiers
wives and
families the
notion must
have been
that those
scenes would
lend the
movie an
emotional tug
but they
are a
disaster awkwardly
acted and
poorly written
insider s
tip these
bits make
perfect bathroom
breaks now
for the
non buffs
at times
the film
can feel
like a
historical pageant
stiff and
heavy handed
some scenes
feel as
if they
ve been
inserted for
the sole
purpose of
having lee
ride up
and utter
something famous
it s
also difficult
to tell
one general
from another
after cursory
introductions about
all you
ve got
to go
on is
a phantasmagoria
of facial
hair from
lee s
trim gray
beard to
jackson s
immense growth
which makes
him look
like he
s trying
to eat
a carpet
remnant the
acting is
on a
generally high
level with
the exception
of the
womenfolk stuff
as always
duvall invests
his part
with integrity
and authenticity
he s
a huge
improvement over
martin sheen
who played
lee in
gettysburg lang
s not
bad as
jackson but
we see
only limited
sides of
him if
half his
prayers were
cut the
movie would
be closer
to three
hours at
least they
didn t
cut turner
s scene
as had
been rumored
he appears
about midway
through the
picture as
part of
the audience
for a
singalong performance
of the
bonnie blue
flag as
he did
in gettysburg
he plays
col waller
patton great
great whatever
of gen
george patton
and even
has one
line not
everyone who
passes an
afternoon at
gods and
generals will
look as
happy but
if you
re interested
in the
details of
our bloodiest
national tragedy
here s
your movie
even so
you should
know that
this isn
t so
much the
prequel to
gettysburg as
it is
the prequel
to the
six hour
dvd coming
soon to
a blockbuster
near you
godsend is
another bad
hollywood movie
that s
hardly a
surprise but
it is
a shame
because it
has a
fascinating and
timely premise
the enormity
of the
ethical and
scientific questions
that would
follow from
cloning a
human godsend
is also
a big
tease because
it features
top notch
greg kinnear
and superstar
robert de
niro as
well as
rebecca romijn
stamos who
takes what
could have
been another
eye candy
role and
turns it
into a
pretty convincing
portrayal of
a tormented
mother in
fact for
the first
minutes she
and kinnear
get things
off to
such a
promising start
that it
s all
the more
maddening when
during the
next hour
the confusing
and implausible
script and
ham fisted
directing sink
this stinker
the movie
opens with
paul and
jessie duncan
kinnear and
romijn stamos
throwing a
party in
their downtown
new york
apartment for
their son
adam cameron
bright showing
remarkable range
on his
th birthday
the boy
is precious
to them
not only
because he
s smart
and sensitive
but because
he s
their only
child since
as it
s soon
revealed jessie
can never
conceive again
as fate
would have
it the
next day
the happy
little family
is shattered
when adam
is killed
in a
freak accident
but sooner
than you
can say
tragedy and
grief snow
is falling
in a
shadowy graveyard
and richard
wells de
niro a
pioneering fertility
doctor sidles
up in
the guise
of a
dark angel
offering hope
beyond imagining
or is
it a
faustian bargain
some scientific
jargon gets
tossed around
and soon
the duncans
have relocated
to a
small isolated
vermont town
where wells
engages in
research and
a bit
of secret
surgery at
his godsend
institute using
cells from
adam s
body he
creates a
clone of
the boy
and then
somehow implants
it into
the womb
of jessie
who nine
months later
gives birth
to the
new adam

eight years
life has
been good

the many
gifts bestowed
by wicked
uncle richard

is once
again the
good son
that is
until his

suddenly begins
to experience
ghastly night

the good
girl is
already being
touted as
the movie
in which
aniston finally
sheds her
rachel character
from friends
frankly this
dismisses her
work in
films such
as picture
perfect and
the object
of my
affection which
weren t
rachel retreads
and showcased
her unique
gift for
romantic comedy
however the
script and
the direction
aren t
worth these
actors time
or talent
director miguel
arteta and
writer mike
white are
probably best
known for
the eccentric
comedy chuck
buck you
hang with
their new
movie for
a while
hoping it
will pull
off the
balance of
deadpan comedy
and slightly
poignant soap
opera it
intends but
these guys
apparently studied
terrence malick
s badlands
and jonathan
demme s
melvin and
howard the
good girl
apes their
ruralized affectless
tone and
aniston s
monologues are
a blatant
rip off
of sissy
spacek s
in badlands
but unlike
the other
movies this
one is
suffused with
a snotty
condescension the
filmmakers are
playing to
the big
boys in
new york
and l
a to
that end
they mock
the kind
of folks
they don
t understand
ones they
figure the
power lunchers
don t
care to
understand either
they want
the picture
to be
goofy in
some incredibly
smart and
original way
all they
manage is
the sort
of thing
that could
elicit a
few private
screening room
snickers aniston
shouldn t
take the
fall for
this and
here s
hoping she
gets some
kudos regardless
of what
people think
about the
rest of
the picture
the good
girl is
a small
independent movie
that thinks
it s

it is

wave film

only beautiful
teenage girls
can be
she s
certain she
can take
care of
herself bob
knows better
and becomes
her protector
like a
bogart character
he s
a moral
immoralist jordan
makes good
use of
the south
of france
setting he
drives us
down the
same picturesque
winding roads
that cary
grant and
grace kelly
shared in
to catch
a thief
he takes
us into
the ragged
back streets
of the
riviera where
a dark
bar is
slashed by
the brilliant
reds blues
and yellows
of a
pool table
he makes
the good
thief look
and feel
like a
better movie
than it
actually is
nolte is
perfectly cast
as this
charming loser
the problem
is he
knows it
having gone
through his
own downward
spirals nolte
recognizes this
could be
the role
that turns
everything around
like john
travolta s
in pulp
fiction or
bruce willis
in the
sixth sense
it s
the comeback
his oscar
nominated performance
in affliction
was supposed
to deliver
nolte is
like martin
scorsese at
last month
s oscars
it means
too much
to him
some of
the character
s raffish
attractiveness comes
through but
we also
sense his
pain the
actor s
not the
character s
nolte is
heartbreakingly eager
here and
his neediness
permeates the
picture a
young couple
s marriage
is put
in jeopardy
by high
society gossip
of a
blossoming affair
robert windermere
is accused
with providing
a secret
allowance for
mrs erlynne
a vampish
older woman
of ill
repute while
his wife
meg courts
the attention
of lord
darlington a

a young

his back
on god

suicide and

by hunky

all the

did happen
that night
she charges

heads toward

ending too
elaborate and
implausible to

movie wants
to be
a mixture
of dangerous
liaisons shallow
grave and
disclosure but
it s
tin eared
and shallow
it makes
last year
s shrill
date rape

shots seem
a work
of sensitivity
and depth

the characters
are unlikable
especially swaggering
oversexed derrick

geeky creepy
travis tv
veteran david
guggenheim er
party of
five makes
a showy
feature film
debut in
all the
wrong ways
instead of
delivering intriguing
characters or
suspense he
seems more
interested in
moody lighting
and the
tchotchkes crammed
into derrick
s swank
loft review
it s
not a
good sign
when a
movie starts
to bore
you even
before the
actors appear
onscreen that
s the
effect of
the camera
s lugubrious
crawl through
an elegant
drawing room
at the
start of
the grandfather
a spanish
movie that
tries to
blend a
pulp fiction
plot with
pastoral scenery
and old
fashioned nobility
after ambling
through a
half hour
of talky
exposition the
movie s
story kicks
in becoming
a turn
of the
century variation
on shakespeare
s king
lear the
count is
the lear
figure his
granddaughters a
bifurcated version
of loyal
cordelia while
their aging
tutor coronado
rafael alonso
is the
faithful gloucester
figure to
the old
man lucrecia
and the
townsfolk who
support her
every whim
because of
her financial
and political
clout are
the upstarts
who wish
to shove
the old
man out
of the
way that
becomes especially
crucial to
lucrecia once
she realizes
that the
count knows
her secret
that one
of her
daughters is
illegitimate the
count determines
to discover
which of
the two
is his
true heir
even at
the cost
of exposing
their mother
s infidelity
despite the
melodrama of
the plot
it s
laid out
with such
talkiness that
viewers will
be either
mesmerized or
irritated if
you let
yourself get
on director
jose luis
garci s
languid wavelength
you might
enjoy some
retrograde pleasures
and the
coastal spanish
landscape in
case you
start to
fade out
the movie
throws in
repetitive sentimental
music by
edward elgar
and erik
satie to
underscore every
emotion review
you know
the makers
of the
green mile
are doing
something right
when you
find yourself
getting teary
eyed over
the fate
of an
injured mouse
at the
same time
you can
t quite
ignore how
shamelessly if
skillfully you
re being
suckered mile
is exactly
the sort
of package
oscar voters
love it
has period
costumes the
kind of
burnished cinematography
that screams
quality a
script that
flirts with
big questions
race justice
morality and
mortality a
hefty dose
of late
s new
age spirituality
and most
importantly mr
oscar bait
himself tom
hanks hanks
plays paul
edgecomb head
guard on
death row
of a
southern prison
in his
cellblock is
called the
green mile
because of
the lime
colored floor
the prisoners
walk one
last time
on their
way to
old sparky
the electric
chair the
newest inmate
is a
pile of
muscle called
john coffey
michael clarke
duncan mixed
in between
are news
reports about
his various
setbacks about
an hour
passes before
lawrence addresses
the subject
of his
troubled past
which began
with a
incident in
which police
found him
armed and
disoriented in
the middle
of a
busy los
angeles intersection
despite his
size he
s a
tremulous childlike
thing scared
of the
dark it
s hard
to see
him as
a man
convicted of
the brutal
murder of
two little
girls the
enigma of
coffey s
identity is
at the
core of
mile which
gradually reveals
his supernatural
healing abilities
the movie
also spends
time with
other prisoners
including the
sociopathic wild
bill sam
rockwell and
the calmer
eduard delacroix
michael jeter
who strikes
up a
friendship with
a mouse
he calls
mr jingles
near the
end green
mile verges
on the
touchy feely
territory you
get from
robin williams
dramedies it
s so
determined to
make you
cry that
you pretty
much have
to submit
otherwise you
might realize
that you
ve just
paid for
a manipulative
blend of
aw shucks
mysticism melodrama
socially conscious
uplift and
jokes as
unalike as
all these
elements are
darabont marshals
them with
remarkable skill
as played
by jamie
kennedy brad
gluckman who
prefers to
be called
b rad
despite the
fact that
he s
all salt
and no
pepa is
a privileged
malibu kid
who wishes
he d
grown up
in south
central los
angeles the
connecting tissue
is the
melancholy shadow
he casts
over the
whole movie
a hint
of autumn
and inevitable
decay that
pays off
at the
end with
a poignant
reinterpretation of
what the
green mile
means his
work is
like a
conjurer s
trick calvin

shot at
basketball stardom
when he
s chosen
randomly to
play against

bonnie hunt

relief jerry

a lived
in sexiness

not really
but it
s a
superior piece
of manufacturing
meticulously crafted
absorbing and
beautifully acted
folks are
gonna love
it like
most of
king s
books even
the ones
that scare
the trousers
off you
it s
resolutely square
at heart
and it
s deeply
satisfying even
when you
know it
s all
a bunch
of hokum
a detention
camp probation
officer creates
a high

football team
from a

of dangerous
teen inmates

from his

a skateboard
road trip
picture about
four dudes
from chicago
who drive
and skate
their way
west at
the end
of their
high school
education every
stop along
the way
looks like
l a
but that
s nitpicking
there s
the ambitious
eric who
dreams of
turning pro
and dustin
who has
been saving
for college
and should
know better
matt is
the generic
gross guy
in this
teen formula
comedy and
sweet lou
is the
dude with
the ride
the van
that will
allow them
to live
and ride
their dream
they re
chasing a
ritzy bus
tour of
pro skaters

at every

is there
to tell
them it
ll never
happen ahh
but they
haven t
seen the
finale a
skate off
challenge in
santa monica
that is
unlike the
rest of
the movie
expertly staged
and filmed
review when
old harry
richard harris
scares his
grandkids with
a campfire
tale of
a hungry
bear he
makes amends
by telling
them a
remarkable adventure
he had
at their
age that
s the
start of
grizzly falls
a sweet
but action
packed tale
about a
boy a
bear and
the bond
between parent
and child
even when
they re
not of
the same
species as
tyrone and
his native
american tracker
joshua tom
jackson search
for harry
director stewart
raffill takes
the right
amount of
time to
develop a
relationship of
trust between
the boy
and the
bear harry
tries to
run away
she cuffs
him for
it she
offers him
a feast
of grubs
while he
treats her
to her
first taste
of cooked
fish for
all its
scenic vistas
and action
scenes grizzly
falls is
really about
something very
domestic the
value of
family bonds
the crux
is harry
s desire
to be
loved by
the world
traveling father
he has
rarely seen
it s
to screenwriter
richard beattie
s credit
that the
theme comes
through without
the sort
of sentimental
overstatement that
mars many
family films
the grudge
is the
curse of
one who
dies in
the grip
of a
powerful rage
those who
encounter this
murderous supernatural
curse die
and a
new one
is born
passed like
a virus
from victim
to victim
in an
endless growing
chain of
horror like
japan s
creepy ringu
which became
the ring
with naomi
watts and
generated million
the sometimes
creepy ju
on has
morphed into
the americanized
the grudge
directed by
takashi shimizu
who wrote
and directed
the original
the new
film is
so red
white and
blue that
even though
it s
set in
tokyo the
star is
sarah michelle
gellar aka
tv s
buffy most
of the
cast seems
to be
from the
states too
which sort
of makes
you wonder
why so
many young
americans are
living in
ultra expensive
japan must
have been
a run
on tokyo
after that
little indie
charmer lost
in translation
it s
not just
any old
house but
the exact
same house
used in
ju on
the house
is cursed
with noisy
bumps and
creaks a
screeching black
cat a
little boy
stuck in
a closet
sealed with
tape no
less and
a stringy
haired female
entity who
doesn t
take kindly
to those
who ve
chanced upon
her domain
despite the
small differences
the grudge
is a
little creepier
than the
original the
american version
s creepy
crawling phantom
is used
a little
more sparingly
and is
more opaque
leaving the
moviegoer s
imagination to
fill in
some of
the physical
horrors inverting
the racial
politics of
guess who
s coming
to dinner
this version
casts bernie
mac as
the well
to do
patriarch who
is surprised
make that
appalled when
his smart
beautiful daughter
brings home
a white
boyfriend review
on the
surface guinevere
sounds like
grist for
a grim
feminist diatribe
about our
culture s
wink wink
nudge nudge
approval of
older man
younger woman
pairings the
nuclear age
has altered
power politics
in a
way that
was already
evident in
the u
s soviet
competition but
instead of
a tongue
lashing writer
director audrey
wells has
delivered a
sweet rueful
somewhat sorrowing
love letter
and her
movie is
so achingly
perceptive that
one can
t help
but wonder
whether it
s a
bit autobiographical
harper sloane
sarah polley
from the
sweet hereafter
is a
bright well
bred college
grad headed
to harvard
law school
in the
fall which
of course
is nothing
less than
what her
wealthy san
francisco family
expects of
her but
harper also
is a
sensitive complex
young woman
who s
spent too
much of
her life
doing exactly
what her
family expects
of her
as a
result she
lacks self
confidence and
experience enter
connie fitzpatrick
stephen rea
the ish
scruffy ironic
photographer at
her older
sister s
wedding his
attention both
flatters and
scares harper
but he
seals the
deal by
keeping his
promise to
keep her
out of
all the
family group
portraits and
sending her
an exquisite
candid shot
of herself
she moves
into his
artist s
loft and
becomes the
latest in
a long
line of
guineveres beautiful
yet malleable

sex sartre

and late
night bull
sessions with
his opinionated
bohemian buddies
over pitchers
of beer
among them
is a
former guinevere
played by
gina gershon
it would
be easy
to dismiss
connie as
a self
serving lecher
who needs
the validation
of an
adoring young
woman by
his side
certainly that
s one
aspect of
him one
that s
made harshly
clear when
harper s
mother jean
smart discovers
what s
going on
this coldblooded
blue blood
mom delivers
a devastating
assessment of
connie that
s as
cruel as
it is
alas accurate
having asked
him why
he doesn
t like
women his
own age
she answers
the question
herself saying
no real
woman could
ever stand
in front
of you
with awe
in her
eyes what
mrs sloane
can t
and never
will see
is connie
s odd
selflessness she
doesn t
notice or
care that
her daughter
has blossomed
under his
tutelage that
she has
become more
confident more
certain of
her self
worth nor
can she
see that
deep down
connie is
all too
aware of
his failings
and of
his ever
more foolish
future after
all even
warren beatty
settled down
at the
picture loses
some steam
toward the
very end
as harper
and we
are forced
to recognize
connie s
diminishing powers
a last
act gathering
of all
the guineveres
is more
a good
idea than
a good
scene in
india where
british and
american companies
can hire
workers at
one tenth
the cost
of employees
at home
writes arundhati
roy in
her new
book power
politics south
end press
and wells
well meaning
portrait of
connie s
aging radical
cronies is
a rainbow
coalition cliche
but there
is much
wisdom here
and a
canny ear
and some
flat out
gorgeous acting
smart is
frighteningly sharp
as the
controlling mother
her tell
off scene
is a
stunner so
is gershon
cast as
a deflating
cassandra figure
to harper
s romantic
notions the
raffishly rumpled
rea you
know him
from the
crying game
hits a
perfect balance
between rescuer
and user
at the
heart of
guinevere is
a salute
to a
gallant spirit
flaws and
all the
movie looks
back not
in anger
but with
a sadder
but wiser
gratefulness as
harper says
if you
re supposed
to learn
from your
mistakes connie
was the
best mistake
i ever
made neeson

bosses when
neeson starts
telling about

in dealing
with the
toughs but
inside he
is churning
neeson continues
his operation
desperately striving
to keep
the two
parties from
killing each
other while
struggling to
maintain his
cover a
comedy of
errors with
a feminist

that neither

it doesn

with creating
a gallery
of intriguing
characters liam
neeson best
known for
straighter heroic
roles in
films such
as schindler
s list
and the
star wars
prequel reveals
a sharp
talent for
comedy it
s refreshing
to see
a hero
with failings
however intestinal
sandra bullock
shines with
her usual
caustic style
a welcome
counterweight to
the all
male doings
she is
also the
film s
producer and
has exercised
admirable restraint
in not
giving herself
more involvement
in the
main plot
a fu

ramu jimi
mistry has
always dreamed
of hollywood
even as
a kid
he would
sneak out
of a
bollywood musical
and sneak
into grease
now a
dance teacher
he specializes
in middle
aged ladies
in saris
telling them
to move
your feet
to the
beat of
your heart
finally he
takes his
own advice
and goes
to new
york where
his heart
beats and
where he
intends to
become the
next john
travolta instead
he becomes
the next
waiter to
serve vegetable
biryani to
cranky new
yorkers no
wonder he
jumps at
the chance
to star
in a
low budget
picture produced
by ramrod
productions initially
he doesn
t understand
what writer
director dwain
michael mckean
means when
he asks
about ramu
s baloney
but once
on set
he realizes
he s
starring in
a porn
movie worse
when dwain
yells lights
camera action
ramu can
t get
into um
action despite
the strenuous
efforts of
his co
star sharrona
heather graham
so it
s back
to the
biryani biz
however his
life changes
when he
helps cater
a party
thrown by
chic upper
east side
socialite chantal
christine baranski
for her
trend hopping
daughter lexi
marisa tomei
the hired
swami passes
out and
ramu is
pushed into
his turban
using his
old dance
lesson skills
and some
of sharrona
s zen
of sex
philosophy he
s a
huge hit
even chantal
is impressed
i thought
we were
just going
to do
some heavy
chanting the
guru is
one of
those two
steps forward
one step
back movies
some of
the dialogue
is laugh
out loud
funny lexi
feels less
guilty about
her wealth
because she
s served
meals to
the homeless
meals i
would eat
if i
still did
carbs the
supporting cast
is dotted
with good
performers especially
mckean and
baranski a
porn star
with more
edge inthe
ultimate porn
cutie in
boogie nights
graham is
enjoyable but
she can
t find
a consistent
tone tomei
by contrast
keeps working
her character
s limited
options she
s a
terrific comedy
actor and
it s
a shame
that even
her oscar
win for
my cousin
vinny hasn
t landed
her better
parts mistry
an up
and coming
british actor
is all
charm he
holds this
often flimsy
film together
and when
he and
graham lead
an all
singing all
dancing cast
in the
bollywood version
of you
re the
one that
i want
just try
not to
grin the
guys based
on anne
nelson s
play faces
a different
problem written
as a
heartfelt response
to the
atrocity of
sept the
piece debuted
in early
december less
than three
months after
the tragedy
a simply
mounted one
act two
character drama
the guys
was a
sorely needed
band aid
for a
traumatized city
taking a
cue from
the new
york times
prize winning
obituary project
the play
concerned a
devastated new
york fire
department captain
who asks
a writer
to help
him compose
eulogies for
his men
lost when
the world
trade center
collapsed in
the movie
the captain
nick is
played by
anthony lapaglia
and the
writer joan
by sigourney
weaver who
created the
role onstage
aside from
the addition
of a
few minor
characters and
scenes of
weaver doing
new yorky
things like
walking the
upper west
side and
riding the
subway the
play is
pretty much
intact nick
slowly stumblingly
articulates his
feelings while
joan listens
takes notes
asks prodding
questions the
movie s
problem is
it s
a tweener
too much
time has
passed not
enough time
has passed
two years
later the
anguish nelson
chronicled has
become a
pain remembered
still fresh
but now
experienced through
the relentless
filter of
time lacking
the raw
immediacy in
which it
was conceived
the play
s flaws
are more
visible we
see the
sentimentality the
schematic seams
the result
would be
half past
dead which
fails as
miserably at
personalizing the
leaden seagal
as it
does at
injecting any
note of
credibility into
the idea
of taking
the island
prison out
of mothballs
after such
action hits
as the
under siege
movies seagal
made a
string of
bombs and
was out
of sight
for a
few years
till a
comeback last
year with
exit wounds
which debuted
as the
no flick
at least
partly because
of the
appeal of
his co
star rapper
dmx this
time seagal
s teamed
with two
rappers ja
rule and
kurupt and
half past
dead is
awash in
hip hop
tunes and
music video
quick cuts
all intended
to bring
youth appeal
to a
paunchy fiftysomething
hero before
you can
say willing
suspension of
disbelief be
damned a
handful of
crooks parachute
in and
easily seize
the prison
from its
army of
guards who
apparently came
to alcatraz
after being
fired for
incompetence from
toys r
us night
watchmen jobs
led by
a disgruntled
prison bureaucrat
morris chestnut
and a
martial arts
bimbo nia
peeples the
bad guys
stop the
execution of
a gold
thief bruce
weitz and
make hostages
of his
death row
witnesses including
the supreme
court justice
linda thorson
who presided
in the
case the
thugs are
after the
location of
million in
gold bricks
whose whereabouts
the thief
has sworn
to take
to the
grave from
then on
it s
nothing but
seagal kicking
the tar
out of
people with
help from
fellow inmates
kurupt among
them the
action is
choppy probably
from editing
to sanitize
the violence
and avoid
an r
rating though
some of
it results
from inept
staging in
one close
up seagal
looks as
if he
s playing
pattycake rather
than fighting
hand to
hand worse
than the
stunts is
the laughable
dialogue overloaded
with macho
taunts and
cumbersome phony
crime world
jargon the
movie hits
a comical
lowpoint as
ringleader chestnut
psychoanalyzes the
high court
justice s
choice to
put career
ahead of
marriage and
family you
forgot about
love didn
t you
your biological
clock ticking
and your
field went
fallow half
past rotten
stuff this
not even
as a
straight to
video slasher
flick if
it s
a friday
night and
this is
the last
video on
the shelf
at your
local store
please i
m begging
you find
something else
to do
macrame perhaps
or ballroom
dance lessons
this eighth
installment in
the horror
series which
conspicuously wasn
t screened
ahead of
time for
critics is
devoid of
wit style
or creativity
screenwriters larry
brand and
sean hood
churn out
the cliches
with such
lifeless predictability
you can
practically hear
the cogs
grinding director
rick rosenthal
also directed
s halloween
ii and
has nothing
new to
offer jamie
lee curtis
who starred
as laurie
in the
original is
back for
her fourth
halloween but
not for
long something
happens early
that suggests
this could
be her
last one
but as
you re
well aware
no one
ever really
dies in
these movies
the premise
this time
as if
it matters
gonzo tv
producer freddie
harris rapper
busta rhymes
picks six
college students
to spend
halloween night
in michael
myers childhood
home he
straps tiny
cameras to
their heads
and broadcasts
what they
see live
on the
internet sort
of a
cross between
the real
world and
voyeur dorm
but without
the colorful
ikea furniture
once inside
the rickety
old house
it doesn
t take
long for
michael to
take them
out one
by one
naturally because
they re
all so
stupid they
go off
individually in
the dark
which makes
it easy
on him
a cyber
buddy of
sara s
is watching
the webcast
from a
halloween party
and is
resourceful enough
to send
her instant
messages on
her palm
pilot to
warn her
when michael
is nearby
this is
a clever
little idea
but theoretically
freddie would
have taken
all communications
devices away
from the
players to
keep them
from exactly
that kind
of interaction
when the
bloodletting is
over halloween
resurrection has
the audacity
to skewer
reality tv
for being
exploitative which
has been
done repeatedly
in recent
years and
only slightly
better in
movies including
series minutes
and showtime
please as
if slasher
flicks weren
t just
as shameless
university film
student true
enough michael
almereyda s
update of
hamlet flirts
with the
ludicrous in
every reel
but it
s ultimately
a compelling
and streamlined
vision that
lives surprisingly
well in
the city
s hard
edged chilly
streets and
penthouses like
laurence olivier
s version
the movie
turns hamlet
s monologues
the ones
that survive
the textual
pruning into
voiceovers the
murmur of
the man
s mind
that s
one of
the few
weaknesses here
the decision
turns the
speeches into
something like
a soundtrack
to the
action the
vengeful anger
of laertes
liev schreiber
comes as
a bracing
burst of
energy opposed
to hawke
s slacker
pout of
course the
play intentionally
sets up
this opposition
between a
son who
rushes to
avenge his
father s
death and
another who
procrastinates schreiber
is good
though he
seems to
be affecting
a semi
british accent
that none
of the
others use
polonius julia
stiles as
the fragile
ophelia continues
to be
one of
the more
fascinating actresses
in her
age group
tapping considerable
emotional resources
for her
difficult mad
scene and
maclachlan draws
on his
smiley seedy
showgirls persona
to make
claudius a
believably slick
cad but
the strongest
performance comes
from venora
a shakespearean
veteran who
herself played
the prince
onstage she
and almereyda
come up
with a
nice sharp
interpretation of
her motivations
to drink
her cup
of poison
that deepens
the character
and her
bond with
her son
review given
the impression
fostered by
the ads
hanging up
looks as
if it
comes from
the same
girl movie
ghetto as
the first
wives club
and soul
food it
seems to
be a
sidesplitting comedy
about three
sisters diane
keaton meg
ryan and
lisa kudrow
trying to
get along
by reaching
out and
touching one
another over
the phone
the real
focus here
is on
the increasingly
dependent certainly
dying father
a once
successful screenwriter
long ago
divorced by
his wife
and his
love hate
relationship with
his middle
daughter eve
ryan all
three of
his daughters
are major
achievers st
century style
but tellingly
only eve
has managed
to combine
a career
event planner
with a
family georgia
keaton the
eldest is
some unholy
cross between
gloria steinem
diane sawyer
and barbara
walters she
s too
busy planning
the fifth
anniversary of
her magazine
the aptly
named georgia
to bother
with doctors
and hospitals
that leaves
eve who
we soon
see was
always daddy
s favorite
but never
could come
to terms
with his
selfishness and
aggression the
dual demands
of his
dementia and
his inevitable
death are
for her
overwhelming somewhere
beneath the
insistently breezy
script of
the ephron
sisters nora
and delia
who based
the story
on delia
s novelistic
memoir of
their father
s death
and keaton
s brisk
direction there
s a
far more
painful and
genuine story
you can
see it
in ryan
s raw
emotional breakdowns
in the
naked fear
in matthau
s eyes
in keaton
s deft
sendup of
what happens
when the
culture s
long designated
caregivers the
daughters opt
for a
career over
bedpans and
hand holding
in other
words this
is a
serious worthy
theme in
many ways
as old
as king
lear it
s the
sort of
picture that
can and
does handle
some humor
but at
heart dares
to ask
some difficult
questions all
the ingredients
in this
long anticipated
sequel are
fresh and
procured at
considerable expense
the preparation
is skillful
the presentation
loving even
lavish the
ambience is
um to
die for
but these
things only
go so
far to
enrich a
dish that
s occasionally
bitter bloody
and not
as complexly
flavored as
the previous
course while
moviegoers are
likely to
wolf it
down they
may feel
queasy later
that s
no fault
of the
filmmakers ridley
scott gladiator
takes over
from silence
of the
lambs director
jonathan demme
while julianne
moore fills
jodie foster
s sensible
flats as
fbi special
agent clarice
starling it
s hard
to imagine
two better
replacements and
of course
anthony hopkins
returns in
silken menacing
form in
the role
that earned
him an
oscar ten
years after
she tracked
down serial
killer jame
gumb with
the help
of hannibal
lecter s
quid pro
quo clues
starling has
hit some
hard days
resented for
her success
and what
the men
around her
call a
smart mouth
she s
already body
bruised from
bumping the
fbi s
glass ceiling
things get
worse when
a combined
fbi dea
and d
c police
raid on
the kitchen
of a
drug dealer
goes badly
wrong in
the media
frenzy afterward
starling is
offered up
as a
sacrificial but
far from
silent lamb
by the
agency s
backroom politicians
then a
call comes
from an
unlikely savior
mason verger
gary oldman
unrecognizable under
an elephant
man mask
of facial
scars a
very wealthy
sicko seeks
starling s
help in
tracking down
the man
responsible for
cuisinarting his
face and
leaving him
paralyzed david
mamet and
steven zaillian
s screenplay
changes that
their finale
is more
palatable though
it includes
an over
the top
act of
violence that
seems out
of character
for lecter
and leaves
you questioning
a couple
of loose
ends before
we get
there though
they also
contrive a
tight gripping
action sequence
not in
the book
set in
a busy
train station
while it
takes care
of the
plot s
main trouble
spot and
eliminates supporting
characters like
clarice s
roommate and
mason s
bodybuilding sperm
seeking lesbian
sister whew
the movie
can t
alter the
book s
lurid lip
smacking tone
hannibal is
an explicit
horror show
revelling in
grand guignol
tactics like
the spectacle
of steaming
intestines splashing
the ground
and even
worse things
involving verger
s army
of man
eating pigs
or lecter
s insistence
on dining
on only
the freshest
meats by
contrast the
silence of
the lambs
worked on
a more
subterranean level
disturbing us
largely with
what it
didn t
show us
the differences
in the
films are
reflected in
the novels
so scott
is really
just being
faithful as
powerful as
its fear
of the
dark details
lambs slippery
slope moral
stance accounted
for much
of its
effect by
that movie
s wickedly
funny fade
out we
unexpectedly found
ourselves sympathizing
with the
devil or
at least
a civilized
cannibal with
a taste
for human
liver and
a nice
chianti hannibal
doesn t
undermine our
values in
that way
because it
presents a
world where
normal values
have already
been inverted
the person
who works
the hardest
for the
highest ideals
like starling
is the
likeliest to
get beaten
down here
the judas
figure can
be a
police officer
trying to
apprehend a
felon while
our substitute
christ seen
in a
bizarre crucifixion
tableau is
a serial
killer hannibal
s landscape
is a
fallen eden
swarming with
snakes the
hard expression
of defeat
on the
once hopeful
starling s
face is
almost as
frightening as
verger s
slice and
dice kisser
while demme
kept his
film poised
on an
edge between
everyday detail
and a
focused heightened
realism scott
pushes his
movie into
more stylized
territory using
colored filters
slo mo
smoke and
shadows and
herky jerky
flashbacks he
seems to
know there
s no
point in
trying to
tell this
story in
a less
operatic way
he s
the professional
barker at
what he
knows is
a freak
show hopkins
slips into
the role
like a
lotioned hand
in a
velvet glove
though hampered
by a
smaller simpler
part and
much less
screen time
than foster
had with
hopkins moore
still manages
to make
a strong
impression as
starling the
supporting cast
includes ray
liotta in
fine smarmy
lather as
starling s
nemesis from
the justice
department this
sunny crowd

audiences at

cheerful zaniness
and flyweight

discovers a

talent for

dance numbers
for little
girls in
sunflower costumes
that wins
him the
admiration of

teacher illeana
douglas meanwhile
harry attracts
his own
altogether unexpected
admirer the
last minute
plot device
weakens the
picture as
if filmmaker
mark illsley
couldn t
come up
with a
good ending
and so
quite literally
he cuts
to the
chase but
by then
the movie
has built
up so
much good
will that
you can
t help
but go
along kudos
to the
cast for
maintaining just
the right
touch of
amiable silliness
northam who
could probably
act in
jane austen
adaptations for
the rest
of his
life proves
he can
do much
more he
might end
up claiming
some of
hugh grant

as for

continues to
carve out
his peculiar
yet irresistible
niche as
the michael
j pollard
of the

has that
stoned one
beat off

with a

nervous belligerence
that s
hilarious in
its total
impotence best
of all
is the

a few
secrets of
his own
happy texas
strikes a
sweet natured
tone that

harry potter
and the
chamber of
secrets starts
dragging its
tail around
midterms after
an hour
and a
half of
generally brisk
action greatly
improved special
effects and
a decent
dose of
dry british
humor it
feels like
time for
director chris
columbus to
kick it
into the
homestretch with
a taut
finale instead
you re
barely halfway
through and
the next
hour plus
of magic
and mayhem
might wear
down all
but the
most indomitable
harry potter
fans what
happens in
these stories
just is
not interesting
enough to
merit running
times edging
toward three
hours the
keepers of
the boy
wizard franchise
decided long
ago to
be as
inclusive as
possible in
the movies
seemingly a
reasonable move
to satisfy
legions of
young readers
who want
as verbatim
a translation
as possible
from page
to screen
but a
year ago
those kids
groused anyway
about omissions
in harry
potter and
the sorcerer
s stone
they ll
grouse the
same about
chamber of
secrets though
it runs
hours minutes
nine minutes
longer than
the first
film still
chamber of
secrets is
fairly fun
despite its
length the
movie nicely
blends livelier
humor and
a darker
tinge than
sorcerer s
stone and
the performances
of harry
daniel radcliffe
and pals
ron weasley
and hermione
granger rupert
grint and
emma watson
are much
more self
assured and
authentic while
columbus sorcerer

essentially was
a cinematic
transcription of
the book
he manages
a bit
more idiosyncrasy
with chamber
of secrets
while sticking
to the
letter of

casting for
new characters

scar on

and whose
butt harry
kicked in

movie touches
on knotty
themes of

portraits of
harry and
his friends
growing up
harry potter
and the
prisoner of
azkaban is
the movie
we d
hoped the
first two
would be
from the
moment the
familiar warner
brothers logo
appears all
silvery and
black and
slightly spooky
we know
we re
in for
an entirely
different brand
of movie
magic to
guard the
school the
prison has
dispatched dementors
skeletal wraiths
that suggest
the illegitimate
children of
a nazgul
and a
banshee but
these ominous
shrouded figures
may be
even more
dangerous than
black they
can literally
suck your
soul out
and they
aren t
especially choosy
about their
victims david
thewlis naked
portrays the
new defense
against the
dark arts
teacher professor
lupin who
becomes harry
s mentor
but has
a dark
secret of
his own
emma thompson
makes a
brief but
hilarious appearance
as the
dotty divination
teacher sibyll
trelawney whose
beaded and
pillowed classroom
looks like
a college
dorm room
circa harry
potter and
the prisoner
of azkaban
sets a
wondrous new
standard for
the series
it proves
that rowling
s books
can be
molded to
a director
s vision
without losing
their heart
soul and
spirit or
most crucially
their magic
as almost
everyone knows
harry daniel
radcliffe is
the boy
wizard hero
of j
k rowling
s brilliant
and phenomenally
successful series
of fantasy
books harry
loses his
parents as
an infant
is raised
by his
muggle non
magical folk
relatives and
has no
idea of
his heritage
until he
turns then
he s
packed off
to hogwarts
school of
witchcraft and
wizardry where
he makes
new friends
learns new
things and
discovers that
he s
famous for
having survived
an attack
on his
life but
he may
not be
out of
danger yet
the movie
reminds us
how very
good rowling
s story
is we
relish anew
her fascinating
roster of
characters her
facility with
fantasy worlds
it may
turn out
that those
who haven
t read
the books
will enjoy
the movie
more than
its legions
of fans
after all
they don
t know
what happens
next for
those who
know every
single thing
that happens
next right
down to
the flavor
of the
every flavor
bean that
dumbledore swallows
there are
changes and
shortcuts but
nothing too
dastardly to
include everything
would make
an already
long picture
hours even
longer but
a well
meaning muggle
and sometimes
he gives
us scenes
that are
better than
in the
book take
john hurt
as the
proprietor of
a wand
shop in
diagon alley
where hogwarts
students do
their back
to school
shopping it
s a
charming sequence
as written
but hurt
takes the
movie to
another level
he knows
the sound
of fantasy
and he
gives us
a terrific
sendoff to
hogwarts itself
where the
staircases move
on a
whim and
the sorting
hat assigns
first year
students to
one of
four houses
and the
sport of
choice is
quidditch sort
of pony
club polo
on flying
broomsticks we
expect perfection
from the
a list
cast of
british actors
that columbus
has assembled
john cleese
maggie smith
and julie
walters in
addition to
those already
mentioned and
we get
it but
there were
qualms about
the novice
child actors
not to
worry watson
and grint
are scene
stealers in
fact they
sometimes overshadow
harry himself
radcliffe is
a dead
ringer for
the book
cover harry
but he
s dreamier
quieter onscreen
he s
good enough
but his
character lacks
the myriad
feelings we
got from
rowling s
version baffled
astonished devilish
brave and
sometimes just
plain wowed
by all
that s
going on
around him
alley shop
in the
case of
harry potter
and the
sorcerer s
stone the
wizard chose
the wand
so to
speak columbus
wanted to
make this
movie more
than rowling
wanted him
to make
it he
gets the
job done
sometimes magnificently
but you
have to
wonder what
amazements a
different wizard
might have
wrought tigerland
a senator
s son
who s
never seen
the inside
of a
foxhole hart
finds himself
plunged into
the war
after volunteering
for a
seemingly harmless
chauffeuring job
he s
sent first
to a
brutal gestapo
torture chamber
then on
a grueling
forced march
to stalag
vi mcnamara
s camp
hart is
assigned to
bunk with
enlisted men
instead of
officers mcnamara
says there
s no
room in
his hut
though we
clearly see
empty beds
and is
befriended by
sgt bedford
cole hauser
who seems
like a
pretty decent
guy until
two shot
down tuskegee
airmen are
also assigned
to the
barrack then
he spews
the sort
of vicious
racial epithet
that begins
with the
letter n
the plot
proper kicks
in when
one of
the prisoners
is murdered
and scott
is accused
of the
crime mcnamara
talks the
camp s
spookily urbane
commandant col
visser marcel
iures who
likes jazz
cognac and
mark twain
into letting
them hold
a court
martial then
he appoints
hart as
scott s
defense lawyer
the misleading
trailers make
you think
this is
an action
flick in
fact it
s more
of a
confined courtroom
drama the
writers may
have thrown
in a
few too
many plot
strands but
director gregory
hoblit not
only relishes
movies with
a twist
he did
frequency and
primal fear
but he
knows how
to handle
them too
intelligence and
restraint are
the main
reasons to
see hart
s war
the problem
is willis
not because
he s
bad he
isn t
though he
tends toward
some one
note scowling
it s
because the
script doesn
t give
mcnamara enough
juicy scenes
we re
supposed to
feel conflicted
about mcnamara
and we
do is
he a
closet racist
does he
put himself
or his
men first
stuff like
that the
mansion s
ghostly owner
edward gracey
nathaniel parker
is a
brooding fellow
with a
family secret
in the
sole somewhat
subversive element
in the
movie it
seems that
sara and
gracey were
interracial lovers
in a
previous life
but the
mysterious circumstances
of their
parting are
known only
to gracey
s butler
ramsley terence
stamp and
madame leota
jennifer tilly
a wisecracking
fortuneteller trapped
inside a
crystal ball
maybe chris
rock should
take a
long hard
look at
richard pryor
s movie
career demonically
funny and
laceratingly observant
in his
stand up
act and
his concert
films pryor
started out
doing interesting
movies like
lady sings
the blues
and the
bingo long
all stars
traveling motor
kings but
when he
and gene
wilder hit
box office
gold in
silver streak
they were
re teamed
in increasingly
witless white
bread movies
stuff like

in which
they both
dressed up
in chicken
suits rock

james rebhorn
with his
eye on
the election
picks mays

new presidential
hopeful choosing
mays makes
it look
as if
his party
gave a
rat s
butt about
minorities but
more importantly
it gives
him a
clear path
to the
nomination next
time along
with some
prepared off

during the

also hooks
up with
beautiful tamala

romantic interest
role it
s the
ol fish
out of

but thanks
to rock
s writing
the picture
still offers
some hilarious
moments when
mays is
offered the
job the
first thing
to flash
through his
head is
being assassinated
that s
what being
president means
to him
later on
mays quits
being a

and starts
speaking for
himself surprise
his numbers
go up
in the
polls and
his opponent
nick searcy

whose slogan
is god
bless america
and no
one else
whips up
a new
series of
ads including
one that
goes vote
lewis he
s your
last chance
plus the
movie features
bernie mac
who as
mays brother
running mate
is a
sight gag
all by
himself in
his technicolor
suits and
fancy hats
early on
the film
has some
of the
sweet and
savvy foolishness
of an
early steve
martin comedy
but overall
it s
sadly unsubtle
and formulaic
rock is
too smart
to make
this kind
of so
so dumb
movie yes
it s
only a
silly comedy
but with
rock you
can t
help but
expect the
silliness to
be laced
with arsenic

to care
about fran

exotic now
moviegoers can
contend with
hellboy yeah
a boy
from hell
but let
it roll
around your
head for
a bit
and its
tongue in
cheek ring
will slowly
become audible
hellboy it
s so
dorky it
s funny
readers of
mike mignola
s decade
old dark
horse comic
of the
same name
already know
this the
concept is
to take
a familiar
monster figure
in this
case a
spawn of
satan with
iconic horns
tail and
all and
make him
an agent
of good
combating fellow
hideous monsters
for the
preservation of
humankind guillermo
del toro
s above
average if
not quite
spectacular adaptation
of hellboy
sticks to
this expectation
flipping recipe
and retains
the comic
s cheeky
po mo
spirit even
the monster
s bookish
mentor trevor
bruttenholm the
fabulous john
hurt looking
like a
german composer
or a
fusty dickens
codger admits
that hellboy
is perhaps
not the
most fortunate
name his
friends call
him red
and red
he is
played by
ron perlman
a fine
character actor
with the
build of
a cinder
block hellboy
bears the
subtle flesh
tones of
a fire
engine his
mount rushmore
jaw enters
rooms before
he does
his devilish
tail curls
but he
has carefully
sanded off
his horns
in a
vain attempt
to fit
in with
the human
world his
right hand
is an
outsize chunk
of stone
that doubles
frequently as
a sledgehammer
his furry
muttonchops connect
to a
snug samurai
ponytail and
along with
some fancy
sci fi
weaponry he
carries catholic
rosary beads
presumably to
fend off
bad folks
from his
brimstone hometown
that s
a confusing
collage of
mythic elements
a nerdy
heap of
hodge podge
the movie
can t
satisfactorily explain
or do
anything with
as the
film s
pummeling action
crashes along
del toro
only throws
in more
quasi religious
supernatural historical
mystic warrior
horror and
sci fi
gunk clogging
up what
should be
a whip
fast joy
ride of
humor and
hellaciousness it
s weird
and funny
and del
toro and
perlman sustain
this swirling
tone of
dislocation throughout
the picture
which could
profit from
a good
minute trim
their playful
levity almost
absorbs the
dreary mechanics
of this
sort of
promiscuous genre
pastiche but
the movie
never finds
its tonal
footing slipping
and sliding
on too
much stuff
from martial
arts ballets
and subway
chases to
raging demons
and boogery
pools of
ectoplasm predominantly
a maker
of art
horror movies
del toro
has a
well rounded
sense of
story in
all his
films particularly
his personal
works cronos
and the
devil s
backbone he
develops an
emotional strain
that ties
the characters
and their
pasts together
with meaning
he also
loves windup
victorian age
gadgetry scholarly
mysteries of
the occult
and deadly
slurpy creatures
hellboy flirts
with emotional
elements even
romance that
never fully
connect because
del toro
hasn t
slowed down
enough to
develop a
cohesive humanism
in its
place he
plunges into
the murky
cosmologies of
the paranormal
for a
climax that
keeps any
trace of
sense or
logic to
itself it
appears that
rasputin wants
to open
the portal
to hell
and ruin
everyone s
day but
i could
be horribly
wrong a
dazzling diversion
with dark
undertones the
movie is
he said
she said
taken to
the extreme
we watch
certain events
from one
point of
view then
from another
conflicting stories
are to
be expected
but not
as contradictory
as the
ones writer
director laetitia
colombani unfolds
the movie
begins with
a sprightly
young art
student named
angelique tautou
dropping into
a flower
shop to
buy a
single rose
for her
beloved a
handsome but
older cardiologist
named loic
samuel le
bihan flashing
a smile
that could
persuade saddam
hussein to
give himself
up she
gets the
shop s
owner to
have the
flower delivered
even though
one stem
deliveries aren
t his
usual practice
next we
see loic
sniffing the
rose obviously
touched by
the gesture
slowly we
learn that
all is
not as
it seems
in this
relationship loic
is married
with a
pregnant wife
angelique doesn
t care
she blissfully
insists to
her friends
that he
plans to
leave her
so they
can be
together and
from what
little bits
we see
of their
relationship it
could be
true we
also get
hints that
angelique s
unwavering adoration
can border
on the
obsessive for
instance when
she sees
loic walking
with his
wife she
angrily spray
paints a
message on
his car
s windshield
but it
s nothing
to get
too worried
about she
is after
all very
young and
very much
in love
and very
used to
getting her
way as
we saw
in the
flower shop
review the
earth of
here on
earth is
stuck in
a year
time warp
the movie
s small
massachusetts town
seems to
have no
fast food
chains no
cell phones
no computers
the townsfolk
drink vanilla
shakes instead
of smoothies
